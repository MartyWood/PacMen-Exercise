# PacMen-Exercise
Create many PacMen by clicking a button and press another button to watch them move randomly at different velocities all over the place before bouncing off the edges of the screen.

## How to Run:
First option to save the files locally to your computer, from the GitHub repository page you must copy the files either through the git clone process of your choosing or you may download the compressed files in a .zip file and save to a new folder.  Right-click on the index.html file to open with a web browser such a Google Chrome.  

Alternatively you can simply navigate to https://martywood.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/

There are two buttons, 'Add PacMan' and 'Start Game'.  You can add as many PacMen as you like in random positions by clicking 'Add PacMan'.  Press 'Srart Game' to watch them move randomly at different velocities.  You can add them, start the game and continue to add more, or start the game first and they will move as soon as they're added.  There is no way to stop them from moving, to restart simply refresh the page.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
Possibly swap out Mr. PacMen with Mrs. Pacmen or add a background image.  No other future improvements scheduled at this time.
